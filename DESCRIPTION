Description: Provided within are two high quality and fast PPRNGs that may be
    used in an 'OpenMP' parallel environment. In addition, there is a generator
    for one dimensional low-discrepancy sequence. The objective of this library
    to consolidate the distribution of the 'sitmo' (C++98 & C++11), 'threefry' and
    'vandercorput' (C++11-only) engines on CRAN by enabling others to link to the
    header files inside of 'sitmo' instead of including a copy of each engine
    within their individual package. Lastly, the package contains example
    implementations using the 'sitmo' package and three accompanying vignette that
    provide additional information.
